# Robot_Arm_ROS2
A ROS2 package designed for planning and executing motion trajectories of a robot arm in simulation, utilizing the Moveit plugin for applying kinematics.


These packages were tested under ROS2 Humble and Ubuntu 22.04 .

## Dependencies
make sure you installed all these packages:
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
     ros-humble-joint-state-publisher-gui \
     ros-humble-gazebo-ros \
     ros-humble-xacro \
     ros-humble-ros2-control \
     ros-humble-ros2-controllers \
     ros-humble-joint-state-broadcaster \
     ros-humble-joint-trajectory-controller \
     ros-humble-controller-manager
     ros-humble-moveit \
     ros-humble-gazebo-ros2-control
```
## Installation

1- Clone the repo:
```
https://github.com/Mjd0001/Robot_Arm_ROS2.git
```
2- Build the ROS 2 workspace
```
cd ~/your_ws
```
```
colcon build
```
3- Source the project
```
. install/setup.bash
```
## Usage
### Controlling the robot arm by joint_state_publisher

### Controlling the robot arm by Moveit and kinematics
run the following commands, each command in a separate terminal window:
```
ros2 launch arduinobot_description gazebo.launch.py
```
```
ros2 launch arduinobot_controller controller.launch.py
```
```
ros2 launch arduinobot_moveit moveit.launch.py
```
